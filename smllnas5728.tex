Consider a system of $N$ linearly interacting degrees of freedom. We collect them into a vector $\mathbf{\bar x}(t) = \left(\,x_1(t),\cdots, x_N(t)\,\right)$ and represent their interactions with random coupling matrix $\mathbf{J}(t)$. We subject them to a global constraint: lying on an $N$-dimensional sphere of radius $N$. These degrees of freedom may also experience an external noise $\mathbf{n}(t)$ and constant bias $\mathbf{h}$. We begin by writing down the Langevin Equation of motion

\begin{align}
