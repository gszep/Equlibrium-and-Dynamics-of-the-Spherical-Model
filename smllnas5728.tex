Consider a system of $N$ linearly interacting degrees of freedom. We collect  $\mathbf{\bar x}(t) = \left(\,x_1(t),\cdots, x_N(t)\,\right)$ - encoded by coupling matrix $\mathbf{J}$ - subject to a global constraint: lying on an $N$-dimensional sphere of radius $N$. These degrees of freedom may also experience an external noise $\mathbf{n}(t)$ and bias $\mathbf{h}$. We begin by writing down the Langevin Equation of motion
